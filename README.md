I know nothing about building websites.
This will be my very first step into my software engineering career.
For now I'm watching yt videos on making websites. (web app)

    showing the big picture to the president of the OU to get the access to detailed maps and security cams for accurate traffic data.
      We could find a open source people counter on footages. (like OpenCV people counter)
